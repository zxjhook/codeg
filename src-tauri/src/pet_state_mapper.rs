//! Background task that aggregates broadcaster events into two pet streams:
//!
//! * `pet://state` — the *ambient* `PetState` derived from cross-connection
//!   ACP signals (idle/waiting/running/failed). De-duplicated; only emitted
//!   when the computed state changes.
//! * `pet://oneshot` — *transient* feedback animations triggered by discrete
//!   events (PendingReview, failed turn_complete stop reasons, git
//!   commit/push, merge abort, agent install, manual `pet_celebrate` calls).
//!   Always emitted; the renderer plays a few loops and falls back to the
//!   current ambient state.
//!
//! Phase 5: ACP events are now consumed from `InternalEventBus`
//! (`Arc<EventEnvelope>`, no JSON parse), while folder/app non-ACP channels
//! continue to flow through `WebEventBroadcaster`. The subscriber selects
//! over both receivers in the same `tokio::select!` loop.
